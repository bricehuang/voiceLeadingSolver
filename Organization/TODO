Features:
    - dim triad, half dim 7th
    - Neapolitan (chordType exists; write scorer)
    - aug6 (3 variants)
    - make results reporting less ratchet
    - compile to lilypond 
    - GUI?? 

Random tech debt:
	- Implement parser for minor predominants (after dim triad, half dim 7th)
	- test ChordWithContext
	- text PrimitiveChordWithContext
	- test ChordProgressionWithContext
	- test TransitionScorer
	- test SolverUtils
	- refactor Parser / move to own package
	- refactor Main / move to own package
	- refactor ProgressionPlayer
	- refactor Key; major/minor stored as a bool is silly
	- internal-cleanup ChordGenerator
	- make SolverUtils.intersect generic
	- less copypasta Chord, Transition penalty type and score
	- less copypasta compute_penalties 
	- Clean up old code which hardcodes numbered BasicNotes
